# PHY 504 final project


For each project you need to do:

- [ ] a github repo

- [ ] documentation (in the README is fine) describing what the program
      does, what assumptions are made, how the program is organized.

- [ ] your code spread out logically into multiple functions / headers,
      demonstrating that you understand how to reuse code

- [ ] a makefile that builds in both optimized and debug mode

- [ ] at least one test (with the docs telling me how to run it and how
      to verify that it is correct)

Some project ideas:

* Tower of Hanoi game (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)

* G-S relaxation

* wordle game (with color)

  have it read in a dictionary.txt file with a list of words

  don't worry about checking whether the word entered by the user is a real word

* few-body integrator

* explore chaos in the Lorenz system
