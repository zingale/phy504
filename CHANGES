Homework:

* Make a driver in the assignment itself, and the students need to write
  the implementation of a header such that all of the asserts in the driver
  pass.

* Class attendance falls off toward the end.  I think that we need to do
  the project in stages.  And then have the project be due 3 weeks before the
  end of class and then have them improve it with CI or unit tests, etc.
  in the remaining weeks.

* Solutions will be posted 1 week after the due date.  Any changes
  after that will not be accepted.
