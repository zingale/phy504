Content:

* Add an example of list-initialization for return values of vectors:

  https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/list_initialization

  e.g., ``return {v1, v2, v3}``

* Add an example of std::filesystem::path, e.g., to separate the filename out from a full path:

  ``std::filesystem::path(pltfile).filename().string()``

  also show how to remove trailing `/`:

   if (pltfile.back() == '/') {
       pltfile.pop_back();
   }

* dictionary using std::map(std::string, std::any)


Homework:

* Make a driver in the assignment itself, and the students need to write
  the implementation of a header such that all of the asserts in the driver
  pass.

* Class attendance falls off toward the end.  I think that we need to do
  the project in stages.  And then have the project be due 3 weeks before the
  end of class and then have them improve it with CI or unit tests, etc.
  in the remaining weeks.

* Solutions will be posted 1 week after the due date.  Any changes
  after that will not be accepted.
