We learned the following commands:

* ``wc`` : count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file

* ``cat`` : print the contents of a file to the terminal

* ``sort`` : sort the input data

* ``head`` : output the first 10 (or specified number of) lines of a file

* ``tail`` : output the last 10 (or specified number of) lines of a file

We also learned:

* ``>`` redirect the output to a file

* ``>>`` append the output to a file

* ``|`` pass the output of one command to the input of the next
