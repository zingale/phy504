Flowcharts
==========

We can represent algorithms using flowcharts.  There are some
`standard symbols
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart#Common_symbols>`_ used in
programming flowcharts that you should be familiar with.

Here's an example of a flowchart of the thought process in debugging a broken lamp:

Flowcharts can also have loops, like this example for a code that appears as:

.. code:: c++

   for (A; B; C)
       D;

An alternative to flowcharts is to write out the algorithm in
`pseudocode <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode>`_

Both of these concepts help you layout the organization of your
program before you start writing the code.

Compiling
=========

Let's look at a simple "Hello, World" program (your text has an
example to computes the square root of an input number).

.. code:: c++

   #include <iostream>

   // our Hello, World program

   int main()
   {
      std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
   }

A nice breakdown of a "Hello, World" program is shown here: https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/ -- let's walk through that.

A few important bits:

* A preprocessor is used to bring additional functionality into our code
  (the ``#include``)

* C++ comments start with ``//``

* Each C++ program needs to have a function called ``main()`` and that function
  is of type ``int``.

* ``{`` and ``}`` are used to denote blocks of code in C++

* The C++ Standard Library provides a lot of useful functions and
  capabilities.  Here we use ``std::cout`` from the standard library
  to output.

* ``<<`` is an operator in C++.  Its meaning can depend on context.
  Here it is used to pass ``"Hello, World!"`` to ``cout``

* ``::`` is the scope operator.  This tells us that ``cout`` is part of a *namespace*
  called ``std``, and the compiler should look there for its implementation.

We can compile this using an online compiler.  Let's try https://godbolt.org/

This will show us the assembly instructions it generated for our code
and by checking "Execute the code" in the "Output" dropdown, it will
run the code for us.


Compiling on the Command Line
=============================

Now let's see how to invoke ``g++`` on the command line.

With your editor, create a file ``hello.cpp`` with the above source code in it.

Then we build our executable (compiling and linking all in a single command) via:

.. prompt:: bash

   g++ -o hello hello.cpp

The option ``-o`` is used to name the executable.  If we do not
provide a name, then the name ``a.out`` will be used.

We can then run our program as:

.. prompt:: bash

   ./hello
