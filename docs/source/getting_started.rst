Getting Started
***************

We will use the Linux computer lab / Math SINC site for the class.

In-class work presentations will mostly be live-coding, where we all
work on the ideas together.  Notes will be presented on the class
website before class to guide the discussion and then updated after
class to reflect what we covered.

You are encouraged to also work on your own personal laptop.  The
easiest way to do so would be to install a Linux virtual machine (for
example, `using Ubuntu
<https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview>`_).
Other options include the `Windows Subsystem for Linux
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_.
