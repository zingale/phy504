C++ Textbook
************

The recommended text for the class is *Introduction to Programming with C++ for
Engineers* by Boguslaw Cyganek.

The companion website is here: https://home.agh.edu.pl/~cyganek/BookCpp.htm

And the code examples are all available on github: https://github.com/BogCyg/BookCpp

.. note::

   We will follow the order that material is presented in the text
   relatively closely, but our examples will differ in many places.

I will note the reading for each section on our course pages, and
present a summary of the core ideas, but I will not repeat all the
content that is in the text, so reading is important.  We will instead
look at examples in class to learn how to apply the ideas.

One thing to note: the author suggests that this text can be used for
3 semesters of C++, so we will likely only get through 1/3rd of it.
But that will cover the major features, with the remaining chapters
diving deeper into details.

Some websites to help understand the concepts we will encounter include:

* codeguru: https://www.codeguru.com/cplusplus/

  This has some nice tutorials on specific C++ features

* stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/

  This is a platform where users can pose and answer questions

.. important::

   C++ is evolving.  New standards are released every 3 years, so some
   examples you find online might be "old" compared to the new
   language features C++ now offers.

   We will use C++17 as our baseline.
