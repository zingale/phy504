C++ Textbook

.. note::

   The recommended text for the class is *Introduction to Programming with C++ for
   Engineers* by Boguslaw Cyganek.

   * The companion website is here: https://home.agh.edu.pl/~cyganek/BookCpp.htm

   * The code examples are all available on github: https://github.com/BogCyg/BookCpp

   The author suggests that this text can be used for 3 semesters of
   C++, so we will likely only get through 1/3rd of it.  But that will
   cover the major features, with the remaining chapters diving deeper
   into details.

.. tip::

   We will follow the order that material is presented in the text
   relatively closely, but our examples will differ in many places.

I will note the reading for each section on our course pages, and
present a summary of the core ideas, but I will not repeat all the
content that is in the text.  Alternate readings from the web will be
provided for most of the topics.

Our focus will be to look at examples in class to learn how to apply the ideas.



.. important::

   C++ is evolving.  New standards are released every 3 years, so some
   examples you find online might be "old" compared to the new
   language features C++ now offers.

   We will use C++17 as our baseline.
