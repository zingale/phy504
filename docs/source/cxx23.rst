Coming in C++23
***************

The main features in C++23 of interest to scientific computing are:

``<mdspan>`` and Multi-d Subscript Operator
===========================================

``<print>``
============


``<stacktrace>``
================

The `stacktrace <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/stacktrace>`_ header provides
functions that allow us to dump out the call stack from within a C++ program.  This
is helpful for debugging.

See the example here for how to use it:
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/basic_stacktrace
