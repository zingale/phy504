Debugging
*********

A debugger lets you step through your code one line at a time and
examine the state of any objects.  This can help you understand why
the code is not producing the results you expect.

We'll look at two ways to debug.  One on the command line using ``gdb``
and the other in VS Code directly.


gdb
===

`gdb <https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/>`_ is the GNU debugger.



VS Code
=======

We can `debug directly in VS code <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging>`_
