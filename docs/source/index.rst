===========

    An introduction to procedural and object-oriented programming in a
    high-level language such as C++ or modern Fortran with examples and
    assignments consisting of rudimentary algorithms for problems in
    physics and astronomy. Students will use the UNIX/Linux operating
    system to write programs and manage data, and the course will include
    an introduction to parallel computing and good programming practices
    such as version control and verification. The course will prepare
    students for courses in algorithms and methods that assume a knowledge
    of programming.
