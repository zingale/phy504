****************************
Create Files and Directories
****************************

.. admonition:: reading

   We will loosely follow the Software Carpentry `Working with Files
   and Directories
   <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create.html>`_
   lesson from `The Unix Shell
   <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_


Let's work through that lesson together...


Summary
=======

We learned the following commands:

* ``mkdir`` : make a directory

* ``nano`` : a basic text editor

* ``touch`` : update a file's timestamp (and create an empty file if it does not exist)

* ``mv`` : move a file or directory

* ``cp`` : copy a file or directory

* ``rm`` : remove a file (and/or directory if done recursively)

We also learned about wildcards:

* ``*`` matches multiple (or 0) characters

* ``?`` matches a single character

Exercises
=========

.. admonition:: try it...

   From your home directory, create a directory / file structure that looks like::

      project
      ├── code
      ├── data
      │   ├── experiment-01.txt
      │   ├── experiment-02.txt
      │   └── experiment-03.txt
      └── results
