Github provides a web-based way to interact with git repositories.  At
its heart it hosts a bare repo that we can push-pull to/from, but it
also provides features to make it easier for users to request their
changes be incorporated.


Creating a repository on github
===============================

Let's start by creating a new git repository using github's web interface.  Start
on your github home page and click on the "+" icon and select "New repository":

Now we give the repository a name.  Let's use our initials, followed
by ``_class_repo``, so for me, it will be ``mz_class_repo``.  

By default the repo will be public, which means anyone on the internet
can see the contents -- that's what we want.

Finally, check the box to add a ``README`` file -- this means that our repository will
not be empty initially.

Our project is now found at: *https://github.com/username/reponame/*,
where *username* is your Github username and *reponame* is the name of
the repository you just created.


SSH interlude
=============

Github works best is we communicate via `secure shell
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell>`_ or *SSH*.  This is the
same protocol we used for connecting to the portal MathLab machines.
