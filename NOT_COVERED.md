Things I skipped:


* ``std::tuple`` and structured binding (Cyganek 3.17):

  I didn't see the need for this when we use ``struct`` so often
  already.  It is neat, but I don't think it adds much to the course.

* random numbers (Cyganek 3.17)

  He uses them with unit tests.

  I should introduce this at some time, but once we have an
  appropriate application needing them (something Monte Carlo).
