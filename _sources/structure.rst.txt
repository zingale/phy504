Flowcharts
==========

We can represent algorithms using flowcharts.  There are some
`standard symbols
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart#Common_symbols>`_ used in
programming flowcharts that you should be familiar with.

Here's an example of a flowchart of the thought process in debugging a broken lamp:

.. figure:: 750px-LampFlowchart.svg.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%

Flowcharts can also have loops, like this example for a code that appears as:

.. code:: c++

   for (A; B; C)
       D;

.. figure:: For-loop-diagram.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%

An alternative to flowcharts is to write out the algorithm in
`pseudocode <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode>`_

Both of these concepts help you layout the organization of your
program before you start writing the code.

A nice breakdown of a "Hello, World" program is shown here: https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/

Let's walk through that.
