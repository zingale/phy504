Shell Scripts
*************

.. admonition:: reading

   We will loosely follow the Software Carpentry `Shell Scripts
   <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script.html>`_
   lesson from `The Unix Shell
   <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_


One thing that this lesson does not discuss is how to make our scripts
executable without having to run them as:

.. prompt::

   bash myscript.sh

To do this, we need to understand file permissions, which will cover next.
