`OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_ provides a *directive-based*
approach to marking regions of code for parallelism.  It supports
shared-memory parallelism and offloading to accelerators.

Some nice examples are provided in the `OpenMP Application Programming
Interface Examples document
<https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/openmp-examples-4.5.0.pdf>`_.
