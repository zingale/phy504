Aside Unit Testing
******************

As we write increasingly complex codes, we want some way to automate
testing to ensure that our changes don't break the functionality.

There are a wide variety of tests for general codes:

* *unit testing*

* *integration testing*

* *regression testing*

For numerical algorithms, we also can discuss:

* *convergence testing*

* *verification*

* *validation*


Unit tests for ``Array``
========================

We can use the basic ``assert`` statement together with a makefile target to automate testing.
