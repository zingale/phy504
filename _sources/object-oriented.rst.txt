**********************
Object-Oriented Design
**********************

The use of classes to organize concepts into reusable software objects
containing data and functions is the hallmark of `object-oriented
programming
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`_.

Core concepts in OO programming are:

* *abstraction* : 

* *encapsulation* :

* *inheritance* :

* *polymorphism* :

.. note::

   your text discusses the `SOLID software engineering strategy
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID>`_ -- we won't discuss that
   here.


Nice discussion about the difference between abstraction and encapsulation is given in this `Difference between abstraction and encapsulation? Stack Overflow question <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/742341/difference-between-abstraction-and-encapsulation>`_.

Concisely, it says:

* encapsulation means *information hiding*

* abstraction means *implementation hiding*
