Why Use the Command Line?
*************************

We are all used to the point-and-click graphical user interfaces of modern computers.  So why use the command line?

There are a few reasons (and see the excellent discussion that is part
of the `Software Carpentry Unix shell notes
<https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/instructor/instructor-notes>`_):

* Scientific computing often involves automating workflows and repetitive tasks.

* Supercomputing facilities are access via remote connections

* Much of the analysis software we use is written as a command line
  tool that is meant to be incorporated into a script, or chained
  together with other tools.

* It helps us understand how the computer thinks about our files and
  data.
