*****************
A Git Walkthrough
*****************

We'll do a walkthrough on git.

.. note::

   An alternate walkthrough is provided by the `Software Carpentry
   <https://software-carpentry.org/>`_ lesson `Version Control with
   Git <https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html>`_ and it
   is highly suggested that you work through that on your own.
